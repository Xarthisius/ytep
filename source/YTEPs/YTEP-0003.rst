YTEP-0003: Standardizing field names
====================================


Abstract
--------

Created: December 11, 2012

Author: Casey Stark

Let's clean up field names in yt, ex "SoundSpeed" -> "sound_speed". The
proposed work will serve to remove Enzo-isms and encourage more consistent
field names across frontends.

Status
------

Proposed.

I started working on the edits in my yt-3.0 fork.

Detailed Description
--------------------

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

The universal field names are PascalCased, while lowercase_underscored names
are more standard in Python.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Editing field names inside the ``universal_fields`` module. I am not sure what
changes we will need beyond this.

Testing
^^^^^^^

I am relying on the existing tests in yt-3.0, but I am afraid it's not enough.

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

This will certainly break some old scripts. This was the motivation for
starting this in yt-3.0.
