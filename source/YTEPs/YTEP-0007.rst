YTEP-0007: Automatic Pull Requests' validation
==============================================

Abstract
--------

Created: February 21, 2013
Author: Kacper Kowalik

This YTEP describes framework used to automatically run both unit and answer
testing for incoming pull requests to main YT repository.

Methods proposed here need to be agnostic with respect to chosen continous
integration system.

Status
------

In Progress: A basic implementation has been created, which now needs to be
modified and changed in accordance with this YTEP.

The code can be seen in ``http://bitbucket.org/xarthisius/yt-validation``.

Detailed Description
--------------------

Motivation
++++++++++

When a new pull request is issued there is no way to automatically test validity
of proposed changes. Every author is forced to run the tests manually, which
requires: knowledge of how to perform the tests, downloading required data,
possessing significant free computing power. This is troublesome and results in
tests being run less frequently than they are suppossed to be. With
implementation of this YTEP the responsibility of running the testsuite will be
shifted from PR's author to designated, automatic infrastructure.

Implementation
++++++++++++++

The implementation will need to:

  * Constantly poll for incoming changes to main repository (or react to POST)
  * Run both unit and answer testsuite
  * Notify the author should the tests fail
  * Notify the author should the PR could not be cleanly merged
  * Inform people responsible for accepting PR that all tests have passed
    (send mail to ml?)

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

There are no backwards compatibility issues.
