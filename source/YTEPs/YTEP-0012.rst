YTEP-0012: Halo Redesign
========================

Abstract
--------

Created: March 7, 2013
Author: Britton Smith, Cameron Hummels, Chris Moody, Mark Richardson

In yt 3.0, operations relating to the analysis of halos (halo finding, 
merger tree creation, and individual halo analysis) will be brought together 
into a single framework.  This will enable the analysis of individual halos 
through time without the need to bridge the gap between halo finding, merger tree 
creation, and halo profiling on one's own.

Detailed Description
--------------------

Here is where you should write detailed description of what the YTEP proposes.
This needs to include:

  * Background
  * Nature of the problem
  * Nature of the solution
  * How will the solution be implemented
    * Brief outline of the code needed to implement this
    * Code examples of using the solution, in appropriate
    * How will the solution be tested?
  * What are any stumbling points
  * What is the proposed method for reaching out to the community about this?

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

This will be a completely new framework for performing this type of analysis.  
Other than working with existing halo finders and potentially reading in the 
output they produce now, there will be no compatibility with pre-existing 
machinery.  For these reason, this work will be confined to yt 3.0.
