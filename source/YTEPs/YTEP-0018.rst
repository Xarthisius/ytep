YTEP-0018: Changing dict-like access to Static Output
=====================================================

Abstract
--------

Created: September 18, 2013
Author: Matthew Turk

Currently, accessing a `StaticOutput` like a dictionary will check the
`parameters`, `units`, `time_units` and `conversion_factors` dictionaries.
This YTEP proposes changing it such that only `parameters` will be queried.

Detailed Description
--------------------

Here is where you should write detailed description of what the YTEP proposes.
This needs to include:

  * Background
  * Nature of the problem
  * Nature of the solution
  * How will the solution be implemented
    * Brief outline of the code needed to implement this
    * Code examples of using the solution, in appropriate
    * How will the solution be tested?
  * What are any stumbling points
  * What is the proposed method for reaching out to the community about this?

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

This section should outline backwards compatibility issues.  In particular, it
should focus on those issues that will appear to the main scripting API: will
this break old scripts?  Will it break internal uses of the API?

Alternatives
------------

*This section is optional.*

What other means are there to accomplishing the goals of this YTEP, and why is
this the best option?
