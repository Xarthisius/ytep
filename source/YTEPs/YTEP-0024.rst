========================================

Author: Bili Dong

This YTEP proposes to add alternative smoothing kernels besides the current standard cubic spline one, make them available to the smoothing operations, and define a convenient interface for users to choose among them.

Detailed Description
--------------------

Currently in yt, the standard cubic spline kernel is exclusively used for smoothing operations. It is a desired feature for yt to have support for varied smoothing kernels.

The implementations of the kernel functions themselves are straightforward. [DA2012]_ is referenced for the function forms and the kernel names.

The bigger challenge is the design of a convenient user interface for future users and a convenient application programming interface for future developers. Details of those designs are explained in the following sections.

User Interface
++++++++++++++

Future users can specify which kernel to use in the smoothing operations by passing a keyword argument ``kernel_name`` to the relevant functions. Currently, functions with potential access to kernels include ``Dataset.add_deposited_particle_field`` and ``Dataset.add_smoothed_particle_field`` [#sfield]_. The naming scheme for fields added through these functions is an extension of the scheme described in `SPH Fields <http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/analyzing/fields.html#sph-fields)>`_, which is proposed by Nathan Goldbaum in `this yt-dev thread <http://lists.spacepope.org/pipermail/yt-dev-spacepope.org/2015-July/019478.html>`_. So a particle field ``("particletype", "fieldname")`` smoothed by a certain kernel can be accessed by ``("deposit", "particletype_kernelname_smoothed_fieldname")``, except for the cubic spline kernel, whose smoothed field remains to be ``("deposit", "particletype_smoothed_fieldname")`` (the same as before).

For example, as demonstrated by the following code, the particle field ``("PartType0", "Density")`` is smoothed using a quintic kernel and the resultant smoothed field could be accessed by ``("deposit", "PartType0_quintic_smoothed_Density")``. [#data]_

.. code-block:: python

   import yt
   
   ds = yt.load("GadgetDiskGalaxy/snapshot_200.hdf5")
   ds.add_smoothed_particle_field(("PartType0", "Density"), kernel_name="quintic")

   yt.ProjectionPlot(ds, "z", ("deposit", "PartType0_quintic_smoothed_Density"))
   
Below is a table of available ``kernel_name`` and the corresponding name in [DA2012]_. All kernels are in 3D (a.k.a. :math:`\nu = 3`).

.. list-table:: Kernel Names

   * - ``kernel_name``
     - Name in [DA2012]_
   * - cubic
     - Cubic spline
   * - quartic
     - Quartic spline
   * - quintic
     - Quintic spline
   * - wendland2
     - Wendland C\ :sup:`2`
   * - wendland4
     - Wendland C\ :sup:`4`
   * - wendland6
     - Wendland C\ :sup:`6`

.. [#sfield] ``Dataset.add_smoothed_particle_field`` is a wrapper of ``add_volume_weighted_smoothed_field``. It is more convenient to use. So, for simplicity, ``add_volume_weighted_smoothed_field`` will be omitted in the following discussions.

.. [#data] The dataset can be downloaded from `here <http://yt-project.org/data/GadgetDiskGalaxy.tar.gz>`_.

Application Programming Interface
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When a kernel function is needed, ``get_kernel_func`` is used to retrieve it. Given the string of the kernel name, a kernel function of the type ``kernel_func`` is returned. Both ``get_kernel_func`` and ``kernel_func`` are defined in ``geometry/particle_deposit.pxd``. The following snippet demonstrate their usage, assuming the source file is in the same directory as ``particle_deposit.pxd``.

.. code-block:: cython

   from .particle_deposit cimport kernel_func, get_kernel_func

   cdef class DemoParticleSmoothOperation:
       cdef kernel_func sph_kernel
       def __init__(self, kernel_name):
           self.sph_kernel = get_kernel_func(kernel_name)

Once the kernel function is retrieved, ``self.sph_kernel`` could be utilized to do the smoothing.

The rest of the changes to the API is merely the passing of the keyword argument ``kernel_name``. Below is a table demonstrating the potential passing routes:

   * - 12
     - ``Dataset.add_smoothed_particle_field``
     - 9
     - ``yt/data_objects/static_output.py``

.. [#pass] This column indicates the possibility that ``kernel_name`` could be passed to 'Pass to', which also depends on another parameter ``method``.

.. [#cls] When a class is given, its ``__init__`` method is meant.

To demonstrate how 4 - 10 utilize 1 - 3, the main structure of the ``smooth`` method is shown below (irrelevant parts are ignored; ``deposit`` and ``particle_operation`` are similar).

.. code-block:: python

   def smooth(self, method = None, kernel_name = "cubic", ...):
       cls = getattr(particle_smooth, "%s_smooth" % method, None)
       op = cls(..., kernel_name)

``op`` is used for the actual smoothing operations thereafter.

For 11 & 12, they simply call the dataset's ``deposit`` or ``smooth`` method to get the smoothing operations done.

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

New functionality is accessed by the keyword argument ``kernel_name`` with default value ``kernel_name = "cubic"``, so existing codes' behavior won't change.

Alternatives
------------

None.
