YTEP-0028: Alternative Unit Systems
===================================

To write a YTEP, copy this template to the next numerical number, add it to the
repository, and issue a pull request.  Discussion of the YTEP will occur either
on the mailing list (for large-scale changes) or in the PR itself (small items,
such as formatting).

This document has been patterned after the Matplotlib Enhancement Proposal
Template (found `here
<https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki/MEPTemplate>`_.)

Detailed Description
--------------------

Currently, yt works with what may be called a "cgs+Ampere" unit system. That is, 
all 


For simplicity, it would make 
Here is where you should write detailed description of what the YTEP proposes.
This needs to include:

  * Background
  * Nature of the problem
  * Nature of the solution
  * How will the solution be implemented
    * Brief outline of the code needed to implement this
    * Code examples of using the solution, in appropriate
    * How will the solution be tested?
  * What are any stumbling points
  * What is the proposed method for reaching out to the community about this?

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

Since the default unit system will remain "cgs+Ampere", and the ``unit_system``
keyword will always default to ``"cgs"`` for loading datasets, setting up 
``Cosmology`` objects, and unit conversions of arrays, the changes as proposed
are fully backwards-compatible. 

Alternatives
------------

The only alternative discussed at this time was to make the unit system set 
globally for a given yt session using the configuration system. Another option is
to make the default base units themselves configurable (instead of always being 
"cgs+Ampere").
