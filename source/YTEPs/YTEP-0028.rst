Detailed Description
--------------------

Background
++++++++++

Currently, yt works with what may be called a "cgs+Ampere" unit system. That is, 
all units can be expressible in a set of "base" units, which are by default 
reducible to the "centimeter-gram-second" system of units, which the exception of
SI current units which are reducible to "Amperes" (and are not reducible to anything
within the cgs system). 


Using the Different Unit Systems
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There will be three ways which unit-aware objects in yt may be converted to a 
different unit system. they are:

.. rubric:: in_base, convert_to_base

.. code-block:: python

    a = YTArray([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], "km/hr")
    print(a.in_base("imperial"))

the output of which is: 

.. code-block:: pycon

    YTArray([ 0.91134442,  1.82268883,  2.73403325]) ft/s
    
A call to ``in_base`` or ``convert_to_base`` without specifying a unit system will
convert to the default "cgs+Ampere" unit system. 

.. rubric:: load

.. rubric:: Cosmology

The community will be notified about this feature enhancement via the mailing list 
and appropriate social media accounts. 

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

Since the default unit system will remain "cgs+Ampere", and the ``unit_system``
keyword will always default to ``"cgs"`` for loading datasets, setting up 
``Cosmology`` objects, and unit conversions of arrays, the changes as proposed
are fully backwards-compatible. 

Alternatives
------------

The only alternative discussed up to this point was to set the unit system
globally for a given yt session using the configuration system. The system proposed
here allows for more fine-grained control at the level of individual objects, e.g.
``Dataset``\s, ``YTArray``\s, and ``Cosmology`` objects. Another option is
to make the default base units themselves configurable (instead of always being 
"cgs+Ampere"). This is disfavored since it does not appear to add additional
functionality beyond the currently proposed scheme, and
