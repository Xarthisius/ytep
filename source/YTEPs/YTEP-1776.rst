Detailed Description
--------------------

Team Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The yt development team consists of developers and members.  Anyone 
contributing at least one changeset to the codebase is a developer and shall 
be listed on the page of all developers (link here).  A member is someone who 
has made continued and significant contribution to the project (changes to the 
codebase, discussion on mailing lists, feedback on pull requests, etc.) for 
some period of time.  After such a period, potential new members are nominated 
for membership by an existing member and confirmed by positive votes from three 
additional members.  Once a developer becomes a member, they remain a member 
for life.  Upon the initial creation of yt membership status, all developers 
having contributed at least 50 changesets shall be granted membership.  The 
<yt member page> gives a description of the requirements for membership and 
provides a list of all members (and since what year?).

Members are eligible to serve as representatives of the various subcomponents 
of the yt codebase.  Representatives shall meet once a month to discuss the 
status of the codebase as well as current or planned development.  One 
representative shall act as the coordinator, in charge of making sure the 
meeting happens (how long does one do this before switching?).  One other 
representative shall act as secretary and record the minutes of the meeting, 
which shall be posted to the yt-dev list and online.  The subcomponents to be 
represented are:

  * infrastructure
  * testing
  * plotting
  * analysis modules

One subcomponent may have more than one representative, but at least one must 
be present the meetings.  
Similar to subcomponent representatives, each frontend shall have a designated 
liason to act as a knowledge-base for issues relating to implementation and 
testing of that frontend in the yt codebase.

Now list members and representatives.

Releases
^^^^^^^^

Minor releases will follow the schedule given in :ref:`ytep-0008`.  Major or 
unscheduled releases will occur after criteria proposed and accepted in a prior 
meeting are met.  Before the release, members will be identified as playing an 
integral role in the content of the release, and the release will happen only 
after all of those members give their approval.

Sic semper inordinatio.

Alternatives

The alternative is to continue with no official guidelines and somehow manage.
