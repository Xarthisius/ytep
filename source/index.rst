yt Enhancement Proposals
========================

This is a repository of "yt Enhancement Proposals" (YTEPs).  Because yt is
relied upon for production-level science, large-scale design decisions are to
be described and discussed before being acted upon.  YTEP documents are set up
to provide minimal overhead to discussion, while still allowing a clear and
evolving specification.

YTEPs go through several stages in their lifetime:

  #. Initial writing of the YTEP
  #. Announcement and/or discussion on the yt-dev mailing list (may include
     implementation)
  #. Implementation and integration, or possibly declination

YTEPs are useful for any code development that affects how others build tools
or infrastructure, and necessary for breaking backwards compatibility.  They
are not necessary for most new developments or any bug fixes.
